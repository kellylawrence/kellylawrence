# KELLY LAWRENCE
###### / FRONT-END DEVELOPER AND DESIGNER

I currently work at [resulta](https://www.resulta.com/) in [Bedford, NS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford,_Nova_Scotia) as a Front-end Developer. Previously, I worked at [REDspace](https://www.redspace.com/), and at [Leech Printing Ltd.](http://leechprint.com/) in [Brandon, MB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Manitoba) as a Front-end Developer and Designer.

In my spare time, I pretend to be a [professional photographer](https://www.instagram.com/probably.batman/), [record videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/KellyLawrence-Master-of-the-Universe) of myself playing video games poorly, create [digital animations](https://vimeo.com/kellylawrence) in After Effects, and record [short musical pieces](https://soundcloud.com/kellylawrence) on guitar.
